        <p class="card-text">Seven Tennis Courts are available at the Club, including four on the rooftop, which are installed with artificial grass that allows less down-time due to wet weather whereby players can continue to play in light rain.
        <p>
        The Club also provide a softer surface to reduce the risk of injury and stress to ankles, knees hips and lower back. 
        Our three courts on the North Shore offer a faster, harder surface so players may play on a surface to suit their preference.
        <p>
        Tennis courts can be booked for 60 minutes per session.  Advance booking permitted for up to five days in advance.Visitors are welcome Monday to Sunday from 10:00am to dark.
