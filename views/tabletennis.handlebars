        <p>Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Can't replace you with a million rings. Boy, when you're with me I'll give you a taste. Thereâ€™s no going back. Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.</p>
